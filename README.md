The inputs include a script that extracts live weather condiitons from the National Weather Service and the outputs are current weather conditions and details for Hartford, CT. 

This script returns the current weather details for my hometown of Hartford, Connecticut. The final output for the script includes the Humidity, Wind Speed, Barometer, Dewpoint, Visibility and Last Updated information for Hartford. One error that I encountered was failing to concatenate my second id tag 'current_conditions_detail' onto my output. I then added the appropriate quotations marks and it was fixed.
